****MATHBOTS****
MathBot is a simple chatbot that can perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The chatbot is built using Python and the ChatterBot library to understand user input and respond with the appropriate mathematical operation result.
****Algorithms***
Here is a simple algorithm to build a chatbot for mathematical operations:

1.Define the operations that your chatbot will support, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2.Define a set of keywords and phrases that your chatbot will use to recognize mathematical expressions. For example, "What is 5 + 3?" or "Calculate 10 * 4".
3.Import chatter bot library and list trainer to beforehand train the values
4.Evaluate the mathematical expressions using a mathematical library or code that you have written to handle the operations.
5.Format the output of the calculation and send it back to the user.
